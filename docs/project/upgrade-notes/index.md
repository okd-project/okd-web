Most upgrades can be completed by following automated cluster upgrade process. Some versions require special attention and this section of the documentation covers these upgrades.

In addition please refer to the <a href="https://docs.okd.io/latest/updating/index.html" target="_blank">product docs</a> for the version you are upgrading to as they will have additional upgrade notes that apply to both OKD and OpenShift.
