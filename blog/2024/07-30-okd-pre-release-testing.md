# OKD Pre-Release Testing July 2024

Last month, [we announced the transition of all development efforts to OKD on SCOS](https://okd.io/blog/2024/06/01/okd-future-statement) as part of a plan to ensure the OKD's longevity. As of a few weeks ago, nightly builds of OKD SCOS have begun to appear on the [OpenShift CI system](https://amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org). We're encouraging the community to test these nightlies in non-production environments. **Please note that these nightly pre-release builds are not guaranteed an upgrade path to final releases. These are only for testing purposes**. You can find more information about our testing needs and how to report your results on the [Community Testing page](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/blob/master/COMMUNITY-TESTING.md).

Please reach out to us with any questions. 

Many thanks,

The OKD Working Group Co-Chairs
