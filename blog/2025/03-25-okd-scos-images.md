title: OKD SCOS Images Now Available
---

Previously, we had announced the [transition of OKD to SCOS](https://okd.io/blog/2024/06/01/okd-future-statement/). As part of that work, starting with the 4.19 release OKD will use CentOS Stream CoreOS (SCOS) for the node images. We have now made these SCOS images available for download on the [CentOS site](https://cloud.centos.org/centos/scos/9/prod/streams/).

Please refer to our [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://okd.io/docs/project/scos-migration-faq/) about the SCOS migration.
