With OKD 4.20 officially released, several issues have surfaced. Below are brief descriptions of each issue and suggested workarounds. Please reach out if you come across additional issues. 

[2255: Upgrade to 4.20.0-okd-scos.0 - nodes fail to start due to incorrect runtime](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/issues/2255)
Effects: Upgrades from <=4.18 to 4.20
Resolution: First, manually replace "runc" with "crun" in /etc/crio/crio.conf.d/01-ctrcfg-defaultRuntime on every node. Then, apply a container runtime override for the masters and workers.

```
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
  name: crun-master
spec:
  containerRuntimeConfig:
    defaultRuntime: crun
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/master: ''
```  
```
