With OKD 4.20 officially released, several issues have surfaced. Below are brief descriptions of each issue and suggested workarounds. Please reach out if you come across additional issues. 

[2255: Upgrade to 4.20.0-okd-scos.0 - nodes fail to start due to incorrect runtime](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/issues/2255)

Effects: Upgrades from 4.18 or lower to 4.20

If a cluster was originally installed with 4.18 or earlier, there will exist two machine config objects (one for worker and one for master nodes), that explicitly override the container runtime to be runc:
- 00-override-master-generated-crio-default-container-runtime 
- 00-override-worker-generated-crio-default-container-runtime 

These two machine config objects can simply be deleted before initiating the upgrade to 4.20. Doing so will change the container runtime to crun immediately, for the current cluster version. This means the machine config operator will reconfigure and restart all nodes. This should complete before the upgrade to 4.20 is initiated.
